                <h2>Wallow County, OR</h2>
                <p>Portland is a seaport and the largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon and the seat of Multnomah
                    County. It is in the Willamette Valley region of the Pacific Northwest, at the confluence of the
                    Willamette and Columbia Rivers. The city covers 145 square miles (380 square kilometers) and had an
                    estimated population of 632,309 in 2015, making it the 26th most populous city in the United States.
                    Approximately 2,389,228 people live in the Portland metropolitan statistical area (MSA), the 23rd
                    most populous MSA in the United States. Its Combined Statistical Area (CSA) ranks 17th with a
                    population of 3,022,178. Roughly 60% of Oregon's population resides within the Portland metropolitan
                    area.</p>
                <p>Named after Portland, Maine, the Oregon settlement began to be populated in the 1830s near the end of
                    the Oregon Trail. Its water access provided convenient transportation of goods, and the timber
                    industry was a major force in the city's early economy. At the turn of the 20th century, the city
                    had a reputation as one of the most dangerous port cities in the world, a hub for organized crime
                    and racketeering.</p>
                <p>After the city's economy experienced an industrial boom during World War II, its hard-edged
                    reputation began to dissipate. Beginning in the 1960s, Portland became noted for its growing liberal
                    political values, and the city has earned a reputation as a bastion of counterculture, which
                    proceeded into the 21st century. According to a 2009 Pew Research Center study, Portland ranks as
                    the eighth most popular American city, based on where people want to live. </p>

                <p>Salem is the capital of the U.S. state of Oregon, and the county seat of Marion County. It is located
                    in the center of the Willamette Valley alongside the Willamette River, which runs north through the
                    city. The river forms the boundary between Marion and Polk counties, and the city neighborhood of
                    West Salem is in Polk County. Salem was founded in 1842, became the capital of the Oregon Territory
                    in 1851, and was incorporated in 1857.</p>
                <p>Salem had a population of 154,637 at the 2010 census, making it the third largest city in the state
                    after Portland and Eugene. Salem is less than an hour driving distance away from Portland. Salem is
                    the principal city of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area, a metropolitan area that covers
                    Marion and Polk counties and had a combined population of 390,738 at the 2010 census. A 2013
                    estimate placed the metropolitan population at 400,408, the state's second largest.</p>
                <p>The city is home to Willamette University, Corban University, and Chemeketa Community College. The
                    State of Oregon is the largest public employer in the city, and Salem Health is the largest private
                    employer. Transportation includes public transit from Salem-Keizer Transit, Amtrak service, and
                    non-commercial air travel at McNary Field. Major roads include Interstate 5, Oregon Route 99E, and
                    Oregon Route 22, which connects West Salem across the Willamette River via the Marion Street and
                    Center Street bridges.</p>

                    there in a log cabin hastily constructed to hold what seemed a potentially lucrative claim. Avery's
                    primitive 1846 dwelling was the first home within the boundaries of today's Corvallis and his land

                    city, and despite its modest size, is the de facto metropolis of the region, owing to the low

                    Census, up from 52,029 at the 2000 census. The estimated population of the city as of 2013 is
                    81,236. Bend's metro population was estimated at 165,954 as of July 1, 2013. The Bend MSA is the

                    1900s. Bend was incorporated as a city in 1905. Economically, it started as a logging town but is
                    now identified as a gateway for many outdoor sports, including mountain biking, fishing, hiking,
                    camping, rock climbing, white-water rafting, skiing, paragliding and golf. In 2015, Men's Journal

                <p>Oregon was inhabited by many indigenous tribes before Western traders, explorers, and settlers
                    arrived. An autonomous government was formed in the Oregon Country in 1843 before the Oregon
                    Territory was created in 1848. Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859. Today, at 98,000

                    <p>This is a web map of major cities in Oregon. It is mainly made as a demo for a course GEOG 371:
                        Web Mapping provided by Oregon State University. The story map library is derived from the
                        storymap plugin for leaflet at <a>http://atlefren.github.io/storymap/</a>, and its functionality
                        relies on both leaflet and Boostrap.</p>
